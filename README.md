# Introduction
I'm hoping to use this to map out what I want to learn and why I want to learn what I want to learn.
I'm also going to highlight the most valuable learning resources for each topic along the way.
## Conventions
### Status
Documents will be tagged by completion status.
* `#complete` -- completed documents
* `#in-progress` -- documents in progress
* `#staged` -- documents that are next in line
Completed documents will also be prefixed with (X) to make it easier to track learning progress from a parent document
### Thesis
I'll attempt to articulate a "thesis", a brief statement describing the importance of learning the contents of the document, for each document.
### Body
The body will be a collection of topics/documents followed by a resource or many resources that explore that topic.
I'll have annotations to make each document readable from top to bottom such that any given document and its children forms a independently complete and coherent resource.
The goal is to ultimately compose of all documents from atomic documents of topic-annotation-resource(s)
